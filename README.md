# MeBridgeBot
Make a bridge between VK and Telegram groups

Add @MeBridgeBot to your conversations in [Telegram](https://t.me/MeBridgeBot) and [VK](https://vk.com/mebridgebot), allow them to read your messages (in VK you should make it in conversation settings, you must be Administrator to do this)

To connect chats, enter `/token` command in first chat to get a special command with secret key.
Enter this special command in another chat (it looks like `/connect $mbb1$1!9d8xxxxx00ca`) and your chats are connected now!

You can even connect multiple chats in the same provider (e.g. Tg <--> Tg or Vk <--> Vk)!
